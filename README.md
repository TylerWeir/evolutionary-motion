# Evolutionary Mace Balancing
Train AI agents to perform mace balancing using an evolutionary neural network.


The following shows training for 200 epochs with 200 agents, 10% random mixins, and 10 agents selected for reproduction each epoch.

As you can see, by epoch 200 (but not earlier!) all 180 agents that are not random mixins reach 5000 score, indicating success.
