agnet.py

Reprsents an agent operating in the simulated environment. Each agent contains a 
unique instance of an evolutionary neural network to control its movements.

Large amounts of state will be kept in the objects such as positions, orientations, 
velocities.

**NOTE: See the flywheight design pattern. It may be of use, though it is 
typically used when there are about 1e5 objects or more

see here for a csgo example: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/flyweight-design-pattern/?msclkid=055e8a0cc06411ec91c2bef75e157f9d
