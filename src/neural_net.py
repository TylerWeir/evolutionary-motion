neural_net.py

Contains an evolutionary neural net of some sort used to determine agent
movement in the simulated environment. The perfomance of a given net will 
be determined via a scoreing function which evalutes how well a given agent
performs some task. Currently that task is balancing a pole.

Currently the plan is to implement the NEAT algorithm though we may begin 
by using a simpler algorithm.

Here are some interesting resources:
